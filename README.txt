Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The goal of this project was to implement GPIO, l2c and UART to create a smart thermostat using the TI CC3220x LAUNCHXL.
What did you do particularly well?
I think that my implementation of GPIO went particularly well. As well as activating the proper drivers for the requirements.
Where could you improve?
In this project I struggled very much with the implementation of l2c, UART, and interrupts.  
What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Through the development of this project, I have added C standard, as well as a better understanding of the structure of embedded systems programming.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework?
Any projects related to embedded systems, the use of timers/interrupts use skills learned from this project.
How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The use of best practices and well-commented code add to the maintainability, readability, and adaptability of this project.
